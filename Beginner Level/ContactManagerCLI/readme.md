# 📇 Contact Management System

## 📝 Project Overview

The **Contact Management System** is a beginner-friendly, menu-driven console application built using the Java programming language. It enables users to manage their personal or professional contacts easily through a set of simple CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.

This program is designed for those learning Java and aims to build a strong foundation in basic syntax, control structures, OOP concepts, and user input handling using `Scanner`. The program runs directly in the terminal without requiring any additional tools or frameworks.

## 🎯 Objectives

- To practice object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts using Java.
- To gain hands-on experience with `ArrayList` data structures.
- To learn and implement basic CRUD operations.
- To work with real-time user inputs via the console.
- To create a functional and interactive Java application without a GUI.

---

## 📦 Features

- 🔹 **Add Contact** – Allows users to add a new contact by entering a name, phone number, and email address.
- 🔹 **View Contacts** – Displays all stored contacts in a numbered list format.
- 🔹 **Update Contact** – Enables editing of contact details by selecting the desired contact number.
- 🔹 **Delete Contact** – Removes a contact from the list after selecting the correct index.
- 🔹 **Exit** – Gracefully exits the application.

Each feature is accessible via a clear and easy-to-understand menu system that guides the user through all available actions.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

| Tool / Concept | Description |
|----------------|-------------|
| Java  | Core programming language |
| ArrayList | To dynamically store contacts |
| Scanner | For taking user input |
| Methods | To modularize each operation |
| CLI | Command-line interface for interaction |

## 💡 Key Learning Outcomes

📌 Understanding how Java handles classes and objects

📌 Using collections like ArrayList for dynamic data

📌 Designing reusable methods for modular programming

📌 Performing safe input operations using Scanner

📌 Managing logic and validations for real-world scenarios

📌 Structuring a simple project for future scalability

---

## ✅ Advantages of This Program

📌 Easy to understand and modify

📌 Purely console-based — no external libraries required

📌 Provides an ideal foundation for converting into GUI later (e.g., JavaFX or Swing)

📌 Code is beginner-friendly and includes basic input validation

📌 Portable — runs on any OS with a Java runtime

---

## 🚀 Scope for Enhancement

📌 Adding data persistence (e.g., saving to a text or CSV file)

📌 Validating email and phone number formats

📌 Adding search functionality by name or number

📌 Breaking classes into separate files for better modularization

📌 Converting to GUI using JavaFX (intermediate level task)

## 🔨 How to Run the Program

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 17 or above (Java 21 recommended)
- A terminal (Command Prompt, PowerShell, Visual Studio editor or any terminal emulator)
- Basic knowledge of Java and console-based input/output

### Steps to Execute

1. **Open your terminal** and navigate to the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd ContactManager java file location
 That is include the java file location indicated in cd " " 
 
 ### Example:
 cd "C\Users\Desktop\ContactManagerCLI\ContactManager.java"

2. **Compile the code** and check the program gets executed or not
   ```bash
   javac ContactManager.java

3. **Run the program**
   ```bash
   java ContactManager

4. **Follow the menu** to add, view, update, or delete contacts.
